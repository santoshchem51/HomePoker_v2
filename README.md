```

## ðŸ“± Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Start Metro bundler |
| `npm run android` | Run on Android emulator/device |
| `npm run ios` | Run on iOS simulator/device |
| `npm test` | Run Jest tests with coverage |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint code analysis |
| `npm run build:android` | Build Android release APK |
| `npm run build:ios` | Build iOS archive for App Store |

### Development Environment

**Metro Bundler**: Starts on http://localhost:8081
- Hot reload enabled by default
- Fast refresh for React components

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes â€”Â this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
