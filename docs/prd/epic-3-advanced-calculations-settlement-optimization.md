# Epic 3: Advanced Calculations & Settlement Optimization

**SCOPE ROLLBACK NOTICE:** This PRD reflects the original Epic 3 scope. During development, significant scope creep occurred (19,400+ lines of complex features). Story 3.5 (Epic 3 Scope Rollback) successfully eliminated this scope creep, restoring Epic 3 to core MVP settlement functionality. Stories 3.1-3.3 have been implemented and QA approved. Story 3.4 has been deferred to a future epic.

**Current Goal:** Implement core early cash-out calculations and basic settlement optimization that eliminate manual tracking complexity. This epic delivers essential settlement functionality - reducing settlement time and minimizing payment transactions through simplified, reliable algorithms.

## Story 3.1: Early Cash-out Calculator Implementation

As a **poker player leaving mid-game**,
I want **instant calculation of what I'm owed or owe when cashing out early**,
so that **I can settle immediately without waiting for game end**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Cash-out calculator compares player chips to their buy-in total
2. Calculation determines payment against remaining bank balance
3. Result displays within 1 second of cash-out request
4. Clear display shows: chips value, buy-ins, net position, settlement amount
5. Handles edge cases: negative balances, fractional amounts, bank shortfalls
6. Calculation verified against manual math for 100% accuracy

## Story 3.2: Settlement Optimization Algorithm

As a **poker game organizer**,
I want **optimized settlement that minimizes total payment transactions**,
so that **players make fewer Venmo transfers at game end**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Algorithm reduces payment count by minimum 40% vs direct settlement
2. Optimization handles up to 8 players with multiple buy-ins each
3. Settlement plan clearly shows who pays whom and exact amounts
4. Total payments balance to exactly $0.00 with no rounding errors
5. Preference given to fewer, larger transactions over many small ones
6. Algorithm completes within 2 seconds for complex scenarios

## Story 3.3: Settlement Validation and Verification

As a **poker game organizer**,
I want **mathematical verification that all settlements balance correctly**,
so that **disputes are eliminated through transparent calculations**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Validation confirms total debits equal total credits
2. Each player's settlement matches their net position
3. Warning displayed if manual adjustments create imbalances
4. Audit trail shows calculation steps for transparency
5. Alternative settlement options available if primary disputed
6. Mathematical proof exported with settlement results

## ~~Story 3.4: Multi-Phase Settlement Support~~ [DEFERRED]

**STATUS: DEFERRED TO FUTURE EPIC** - Removed during Epic 3 scope rollback (Story 3.5)

~~As a **poker game with players leaving at different times**,~~
~~I want **settlement calculations that handle multiple cash-out phases**,~~
~~so that **early leavers can settle while others continue playing**.~~

### ~~Acceptance Criteria~~ [SCOPE ROLLBACK]
This story was identified as scope creep during the Epic 3 rollback (Story 3.5) and has been deferred to maintain focus on core MVP settlement functionality. The multi-phase settlement feature should be considered for a future epic focused on advanced settlement workflows.

## Story 3.5: Settlement Algorithm Performance Validation

As a **developer**,
I want **to validate that settlement calculations meet performance requirements**,
so that **the app delivers instant results even with complex multi-player scenarios**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Performance test suite for settlement calculations with 4-8 players
2. Test scenarios include 10, 25, 50, and 100+ transactions per session
3. Settlement optimization completes within 2 seconds for all test cases
4. Memory usage during calculations stays under 50MB
5. Performance regression tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline
6. Fallback to simpler algorithm if optimization exceeds time limit
7. Performance metrics logged for production monitoring
8. Stress test with maximum complexity (8 players, 100 transactions, multiple cash-outs)
