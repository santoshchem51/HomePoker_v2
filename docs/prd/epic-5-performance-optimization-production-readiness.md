# Epic 5: Performance Optimization & Production Readiness

**Expanded Goal:** Optimize local database operations, ensure production-quality performance, and implement comprehensive testing coverage for reliable app store deployment. This epic ensures the monolithic mobile architecture performs optimally for real-world usage.

## Story 5.1: SQLite Database Optimization

As a **poker session manager**,
I want **fast database operations that don't slow down the game**,
so that **recording transactions feels instant during live play**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Database operations complete within 100ms for typical queries
2. Proper indexing implemented for all query patterns
3. WAL mode enabled for concurrent read/write performance
4. Connection pooling and optimization settings configured
5. Query optimization with EXPLAIN analysis
6. Memory usage stays under 50MB for database operations

## Story 5.2: App Performance Optimization

As a **poker player**,
I want **the app to be fast and responsive**,
so that **I can quickly record transactions without delays during live games**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. App startup time under 3 seconds on average devices
2. UI remains responsive during database operations
3. Memory usage stays under 150MB during normal operation
4. Component memoization and callback optimization implemented
5. Lazy loading for large transaction lists
6. Bundle size optimization (under 50MB APK/IPA)

## Story 5.3: Comprehensive Testing Suite

As a **developer**,
I want **comprehensive test coverage for all critical functionality**,
so that **financial calculations and core features work reliably in production**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Unit test coverage â‰¥90% for critical paths (financial calculations, database operations)
2. Integration tests for complete user flows
3. Performance tests for all database operations
4. Memory leak detection and prevention
5. Automated testing pipeline in CI/CD
6. Error logging and crash reporting system

## Story 5.4: Production Deployment Preparation

As a **product manager**,
I want **production-ready builds optimized for app store deployment**,
so that **users get a polished, reliable experience**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Production build optimization and minification
2. App signing and security configuration
3. Privacy compliance and data handling documentation
4. Performance monitoring and metrics collection
5. Error analytics and user session recording
6. App store metadata and screenshots prepared

## Story 5.5: Device Compatibility Testing

As a **quality assurance engineer**,
I want **to verify the app works reliably across all target devices**,
so that **all users have a consistent experience regardless of their device**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Minimum device requirements documented:
   - iOS 15.0+ with minimum iPhone 8/SE 2nd gen
   - Android 11+ with 4GB RAM minimum
   - SQLite performance validated on minimum spec devices
2. Device compatibility matrix tested:
   - iPhone: 8, SE 2nd gen, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 series
   - Android: Samsung Galaxy S20+, Google Pixel 5+, OnePlus 8+
   - Tablets: iPad 9th gen+, Samsung Tab A8+
3. Performance benchmarks on minimum spec devices:
   - SQLite queries complete within 150ms (relaxed from 100ms target)
   - App startup under 5 seconds on minimum devices
   - Memory usage under 200MB on low-end devices
4. Specific SQLite optimizations for older devices documented
5. Graceful degradation for devices below minimum specs
6. Device-specific bug tracking and resolution
7. Automated device testing in CI/CD via cloud device farms
