# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Transform chaotic WhatsApp money tracking into streamlined, dispute-free poker night experience
- Eliminate 15-20 minute settlement calculations through automated optimization algorithms  
- Reduce settlement disputes from 70% to under 10% through transparent, reliable tracking

- Enable instant early cash-out calculations for mid-game departures
- Create entertaining poker night amplifier that groups actively request for future games

## Background Context

Home poker players currently rely on scattered WhatsApp messages to track buy-ins and settlements, creating organizational chaos that intensifies over 3-4 hour sessions. Critical financial information becomes buried in hundreds of chat messages between game commentary and social banter, with unclear shorthand like "same" or "+1" becoming impossible to decode during final settlements.

PokePot addresses this by becoming the invisible infrastructure that makes home poker nights run smoothly - similar to how Venmo simplified splitting restaurant bills. The solution leverages existing WhatsApp group dynamics rather than replacing them, using local data management and easy sharing to transform necessary tracking into entertainment enhancement.
