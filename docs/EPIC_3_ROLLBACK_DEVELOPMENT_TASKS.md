- **Dependencies:** Remove 2 external dependencies
- **Test Files:** Reduce from 15+ complex test files to 3 simple ones
- **Components:** Remove 5+ complex UI components

### Functionality Preservation
- ✅ Early cash-out calculation still works
- ✅ Settlement optimization algorithm still works  
- ✅ Basic settlement validation still works
- ✅ LiveGameScreen transaction entry still works
- ✅ Integration with Epic 1/2 functionality preserved

### Quality Gates
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [ ] ESLint passes without errors
- [ ] Simplified test suite passes (100% success rate)
- [ ] React Native app builds and runs without crashes
- [ ] Visual validation demonstrates working Epic 3 core functionality

## Developer Notes

**Key Principle:** This is a restoration, not a destruction. We're removing unnecessary complexity while preserving core Epic 3 value.

**Approach:** Be systematic and thorough. Each phase builds on the previous one. Don't skip the completion criteria checks.

**Testing Strategy:** After each phase, run `npm run typecheck` and fix any broken imports immediately.

**Documentation:** Keep notes on what you remove so we can reference it if needed for post-MVP features.

## Handoff Checklist

Before marking Story 3.5 as complete:
- [ ] All 4 phases completed with criteria met
- [ ] Epic 3 core functionality demonstrated working
- [ ] Visual validation documentation created
- [ ] Stories 3.1-3.3 ready for "Done" status
- [ ] Clean codebase ready for QA validation
- [ ] Developer notes and lessons learned documented

**Developer:** Complete this checklist systematically. Each checked box represents validated completion of that task. This systematic approach ensures nothing is missed in the Epic 3 scope rollback process.
