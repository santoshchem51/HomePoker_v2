# Task 2 Integration Validation Report
## Epic 3: Settlement Optimization - Story 3.2

### Overview
This report validates the successful integration of Task 2 Settlement Plan Visualization Components with Task 1 optimization services.

### Task 2 Components Implemented

#### 2. Data Flow Validation
```typescript
// Task 1 Service → Task 2 Hook → Task 2 Components
SettlementService.optimizeSettlement(sessionId)
  → settlementStore.optimizeSettlement()
  → useSettlementOptimization()
  → SettlementPlanDisplay/SettlementComparison
```
