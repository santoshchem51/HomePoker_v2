## Dev Notes

### Previous Epic Context
From Epic 1 and Epic 2 completion, we have:
- Solid React Native 0.80.2 foundation with TypeScript
- Comprehensive service layer: DatabaseService, SessionService, TransactionService
- Established patterns for Zustand state management and component architecture
- Voice integration infrastructure completed
- Professional error handling with ServiceError class

### Settlement Service Architecture Requirements
**SettlementService Implementation** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Location: src/services/settlement/SettlementService.ts
- Singleton pattern consistent with existing services
- Dependencies: DatabaseService, SessionService, TransactionService
- Key interfaces:
  - `calculateEarlyCashOut(sessionId: string, playerId: string, chipValue: number): Promise<EarlyCashOutResult>`
  - `validateSettlement(result: EarlyCashOutResult): boolean`
  - `getSettlementOptions(sessionId: string, playerId: string): Promise<SettlementOption[]>`

**Early Cash-out Calculation Logic** [Source: epic-3 requirements]
```typescript
interface EarlyCashOutResult {
  playerId: string;
  chipValue: number;        // Current chips the player holds
  totalBuyIns: number;      // Sum of all buy-ins for this player
  netPosition: number;      // chipValue - totalBuyIns (positive = player wins, negative = player owes)
  settlementAmount: number; // Amount to pay/receive from bank
  bankBalance: number;      // Remaining bank balance after settlement
  isValid: boolean;         // Whether settlement is mathematically valid
  warnings: string[];       // Any warnings about the settlement
  calculationTime: number;  // Processing time in milliseconds
}
```
