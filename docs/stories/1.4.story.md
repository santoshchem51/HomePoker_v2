# Story 1.4: Cash-out Transaction Recording

## Status
✅ **DONE** - QA approved and ready for production

## Story

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Cash-out entry interface accepts player selection and dollar amount
2. Transaction timestamp automatically recorded with each cash-out
3. Player running balance updates to show net position (positive/negative)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 completion, key learnings relevant to this story:
- ✅ **TransactionService foundation COMPLETE** - Buy-in recording, validation, and undo already implemented
- ✅ **TransactionForm component EXISTS** - Form component with player selection and amount input ready for extension
- ✅ **UndoManager utility READY** - 30-second undo functionality available for cash-out implementation
- ✅ **sessionStore with transaction management** - State management patterns established for transaction data
- **IMPORTANT**: All existing transaction infrastructure can be extended for cash-out functionality
- **KEY PATTERN**: Use existing validation and business rule patterns from buy-in implementation

### Data Models
**Transaction Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#transaction-model]
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  playerId: string;
  type: 'buy_in' | 'cash_out';  // ← cash_out type already defined
  amount: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  method: 'voice' | 'manual';
  isVoided: boolean;
  description?: string;
}
```

**Player Model Updates** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#player-model]
```typescript
interface Player {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  name: string;
  isGuest: boolean;
  profileId?: string;
  currentBalance: number;        // Will show negative for players who lost money
  totalBuyIns: number;          // Remains constant during cash-outs
  totalCashOuts: number;        // ← Updated by cash-out transactions
  status: 'active' | 'cashed_out';  // ← Status managed by cash-out flow
  joinedAt: Date;
}
```

### Database Schema Requirements
**Transactions Table** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#sqlite-schema-definition]
- All transaction infrastructure already supports 'cash_out' type
- Existing validation: `type TEXT CHECK(type IN ('buy_in', 'cash_out')) NOT NULL`
- Existing indexes support cash-out queries: `INDEX idx_transactions_type ON transactions(session_id, type)`

### Component Specifications
**TransactionProcessor Component** [Source: architecture/components.md#transactionprocessor-component]
- `recordCashOut(playerId: string, amount: number): Promise<Transaction>` - Process cash-out transaction  
- `calculatePlayerBalance(playerId: string): Promise<PlayerBalance>` - Real-time balance computation (already implemented)
- Dependencies: SessionManager for session validation, DatabaseService for transaction persistence
- Technology Stack: TypeScript business logic with React Query for optimistic updates, SQLite transactions for data integrity

### File Locations
**Component File Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- `src/services/core/TransactionService.ts` - **EXTEND EXISTING** with cash-out methods
- `src/screens/LiveGame/TransactionForm.tsx` - **EXTEND EXISTING** with cash-out mode
- `src/components/poker/TransactionHistory.tsx` - **EXTEND EXISTING** with cash-out display
- `src/components/poker/UndoButton.tsx` - **EXTEND EXISTING** with cash-out undo
- `src/stores/sessionStore.ts` - **EXTEND EXISTING** with player status management
- `src/services/core/SessionValidationService.ts` - **NEW FILE** for balance validation
- `src/types/transaction.ts` - **EXTEND EXISTING** with cash-out specific types

### Technical Constraints
**Service Layer Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Never bypass service layer - all database operations must go through DatabaseService
- All multi-step database operations (cash-out + player balance update + status change) must use `DatabaseService.executeTransaction()` with proper rollback
- All service methods must use consistent ServiceError class with proper error codes
- Financial calculations must use `CalculationUtils.subtractAmounts()` for currency precision

**State Management Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Never mutate Zustand store state directly - use store actions that maintain immutability
- Type Sharing: Always define shared types in `src/types/` and import consistently

**Financial Precision Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Always use `CalculationUtils.addAmounts()`, `CalculationUtils.subtractAmounts()` for currency math
- Prevent floating-point precision errors in financial calculations
- Input validation through `ValidationService` before processing

### Business Rules and Validation
**Cash-out Validation Requirements**
- Cash-out amounts must be positive and have maximum 2 decimal places
- Only allow cash-outs for active sessions (status = 'active')
- Only allow cash-outs for players with status = 'active'
- Prevent cash-outs exceeding player's total buy-ins unless organizer confirms
- Session total cash-outs cannot exceed session total buy-ins
- All amounts must be validated through existing ValidationService patterns

### Workflow Integration
**Cash-out Recording Workflow** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-2-voice-enabled-transaction-recording]
1. User inputs cash-out via TransactionForm (player selection + amount)
2. TransactionService.recordCashOut() called with playerId, amount, method='manual'
3. Validation: Check amount <= player's total buy-ins OR trigger organizer confirmation
4. Database transaction: BEGIN
5. INSERT into transactions table with type='cash_out'
6. UPDATE player total_cash_outs and current_balance (subtract amount)
7. UPDATE player status to 'cashed_out' if they are leaving
8. UPDATE session validation checks
9. Database transaction: COMMIT
10. Store state updated with new transaction and balances
11. UI shows success feedback and updated player net position

### Session Balance Validation Requirements
- Session total buy-ins must always equal or exceed total cash-outs
- Real-time monitoring to prevent over-distribution
- Organizer override capability for exceptional circumstances
- Mathematical verification of all balance calculations
- Warning systems before approaching balance limits
