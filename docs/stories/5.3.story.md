## Notes
This story enhances the existing comprehensive testing infrastructure to achieve production-ready test coverage and reliability. The focus is on expanding coverage for critical paths, especially financial calculations and database operations, while building upon the performance monitoring foundations established in Stories 5.1 and 5.2.

The testing approach prioritizes:
1. **Critical Path Coverage** - 90%+ coverage for financial calculations and database operations
2. **Integration Testing** - Complete user flow validation with proper service mocking  
3. **Performance Validation** - Database and app performance regression prevention
4. **Memory Management** - Leak detection and prevention throughout the application
5. **CI/CD Integration** - Automated testing pipeline with deployment blocking on failures
6. **Error Monitoring** - Comprehensive logging and crash reporting for production readiness

All testing enhancements maintain the existing architectural patterns, utilizing centralized mock factories, native Zustand testing, and React 19 compatible testing strategies. The testing suite must ensure financial accuracy and reliability while supporting the ongoing development workflow.

Key technical considerations:
- React Native Testing Library for component testing compliance
- Centralized mock architecture extension rather than replacement
- Performance testing integration with existing monitoring systems
- Financial calculation precision validation with comprehensive edge cases
- Service isolation maintenance with proper external service mocking
