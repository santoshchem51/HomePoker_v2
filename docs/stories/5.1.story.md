# Story 5.1: SQLite Database Optimization

## Status  
**Done** ✅

## Story
**As a** poker session manager,
**I want** fast database operations that don't slow down the game,
**so that** recording transactions feels instant during live play.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Database operations complete within 100ms for typical queries
2. Proper indexing implemented for all query patterns
3. WAL mode enabled for concurrent read/write performance
4. Connection pooling and optimization settings configured
5. Query optimization with EXPLAIN analysis
6. Memory usage stays under 50MB for database operations

## Technical Context

### Existing Implementation Foundation
- **DatabaseService** located at `src/services/infrastructure/DatabaseService.ts` with WAL mode already enabled
- **Current PRAGMA settings**: journal_mode=WAL, synchronous=NORMAL, cache_size=10000, foreign_keys=ON
- **Schema**: sessions, players, transactions, player_profiles tables with foreign key constraints
- **Testing infrastructure** in place with isolated database instances for testing

### Architecture Requirements
- Optimize existing SQLite configuration for sub-100ms query performance
- Follow React Native SQLite patterns with react-native-sqlite-storage
- Maintain service layer architecture with enhanced performance monitoring
- Use existing ServiceError patterns for error handling
- Implement query analysis and optimization tools

## Dependencies
- Builds upon existing DatabaseService infrastructure
- Requires existing SQLite database schema and migration system
- Depends on react-native-sqlite-storage library
- Utilizes existing ServiceError and testing patterns
- May require React Native performance monitoring libraries
- Depends on existing database test infrastructure

## Notes
This story focuses on optimizing the existing SQLite database implementation to meet production performance requirements. The emphasis is on achieving sub-100ms query times while maintaining data integrity and the existing API surface. Performance monitoring and analysis tools are critical for ongoing optimization and maintenance.

The optimization approach prioritizes:
1. **Configuration optimization** - PRAGMA settings and connection management
2. **Strategic indexing** - Based on actual query patterns in the codebase
3. **Query optimization** - EXPLAIN analysis and prepared statements
4. **Performance monitoring** - Real-time metrics and alerting
5. **Development tools** - For ongoing performance analysis and optimization

All optimizations must maintain backward compatibility with existing service interfaces and preserve the current database schema and migration system.
