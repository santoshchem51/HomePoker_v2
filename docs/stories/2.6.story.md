# Story 2.6A: Basic Voice Fallback (Simplified)

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** poker player,
**I want** basic manual input options when voice recognition is unavailable,
**so that** I can always track transactions using the existing touch interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Voice capability detection on app startup only (not runtime monitoring)
2. Basic visual indicator for voice availability (simple state display)
3. Manual mode override toggle (simple switch, not automatic fallback)
4. Use existing TouchBuyInInterface without modification (no new manual interface)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add basic voice capability detection to VoiceService (startup only)
  - [ ] Add startup capability detection using existing VoiceService.checkCapabilities()
  - [ ] Store capability results in voiceStore for app-wide access

- [ ] Create simple VoiceStatusIndicator component (basic state display)
  - [ ] Design basic component with available/unavailable states
  - [ ] Integrate with existing VoiceCommandPanel component

- [ ] Add manual mode toggle to VoiceCommandPanel (simple switch)
  - [ ] Create simple toggle component for voice/manual switching
  - [ ] Add basic mode state management in voiceStore

- [ ] Integration testing for basic fallback workflow
  - [ ] Test startup capability detection
  - [ ] Test basic visual indicators
  - [ ] Test manual mode toggle functionality
  - [ ] Test integration with existing TouchBuyInInterface

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 2.1-2.5, the foundation includes:
- VoiceService with basic capability detection (checkCapabilities() method)
- TouchBuyInInterface with complete manual buy-in functionality  
- voiceStore with state management for voice recognition states

### Simplified Architecture Approach
This story focuses on core functionality only:
- Basic voice capability detection on startup (no runtime monitoring)
- Simple visual indicator component (available/unavailable states only)
- Basic manual mode toggle (simple switch, not automatic fallback)
- Use existing TouchBuyInInterface as-is (no modifications needed)

### Basic Voice Capability Detection
**VoiceService Extension** [Source: VoiceService.ts]
- Use existing VoiceService.checkCapabilities() method for startup detection
- Store basic capability state in existing voiceStore
- No runtime monitoring or complex capability tracking

**Simple Detection Implementation:**
```typescript
// Add to existing VoiceService
async checkStartupCapabilities(): Promise<boolean> {
  // Use existing checkCapabilities() logic
  // Store simple true/false state in voiceStore
}
```

### Basic Visual Indicator
**VoiceStatusIndicator Component** [Location: src/components/voice/VoiceStatusIndicator.tsx]
- Simple component with two states: available/unavailable
- Basic green/red indicator styling
- Integration with existing VoiceCommandPanel

**Simple Visual States:**
```typescript
interface SimpleVoiceStatus {
  available: boolean;
}

// Simple display: green (available) or red (unavailable)
```

### Basic Mode Toggle
**Simple Toggle Integration** [Source: VoiceCommandPanel.tsx]
- Add basic toggle switch to existing VoiceCommandPanel
- Simple voice/manual mode state in voiceStore
- No automatic fallback - manual user control only

**Basic Mode State:**
```typescript
// Extend existing voiceStore with simple mode
interface SimpleVoiceMode {
  inputMode: 'voice' | 'manual';
}
```

### File Locations (Minimal)
**New Components:**
- VoiceStatusIndicator.tsx ‚Üí src/components/voice/VoiceStatusIndicator.tsx

**Modified Components:**
- VoiceCommandPanel.tsx (add indicator and toggle)
- voiceStore.ts (add basic mode state)
- VoiceService.ts (add startup capability check)
