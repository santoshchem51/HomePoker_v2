## Dependencies
- **Builds upon Story 5.1**: SQLite database optimization provides foundation for app performance

- Depends on Zustand state management system
- Utilizes existing service layer (SessionService, TransactionService, ProfileService)
- May require React Native performance monitoring libraries
- Depends on existing testing infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline

## Notes
This story focuses on optimizing the React Native app performance to complement the database optimizations from Story 5.1. The emphasis is on achieving production-quality performance across app startup, UI responsiveness, memory usage, and bundle size while maintaining the existing functionality and architecture.

The optimization approach prioritizes:
1. **Startup optimization** - Fast app initialization with lazy loading
2. **UI responsiveness** - Non-blocking operations with optimistic updates
3. **Memory management** - Efficient memory usage with monitoring and cleanup
4. **Component optimization** - Memoization and callback optimization patterns
5. **Data handling optimization** - Virtualization and lazy loading for large datasets
6. **Bundle optimization** - Code splitting and asset optimization for smaller packages

All optimizations must maintain backward compatibility with existing component interfaces and preserve the current service architecture. The performance improvements should build upon the database optimizations from Story 5.1 to create a cohesive, production-ready performance profile.

Key technical considerations:
- React 19 compatibility with concurrent features
- Integration with optimized SQLite performance from Story 5.1
- Zustand store optimization with performance-focused selectors
- React Native platform-specific optimizations for iOS and Android
- Production monitoring and alerting for performance thresholds
