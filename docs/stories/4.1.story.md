# Story 4.1: WhatsApp URL Scheme Integration

## Status  
**Done**

## Story
**As a** poker game organizer,
**I want** to easily share session results to WhatsApp with pre-formatted messages,
**so that** my poker group gets clear settlement information without manual typing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. "Share to WhatsApp" button on session completion screen
2. WhatsApp opens with pre-filled, formatted settlement message
3. Message includes player names, buy-ins, cash-outs, and settlements
4. User can select which WhatsApp chat/group to share with
5. Fallback to clipboard copy if WhatsApp unavailable
6. Message preview before opening WhatsApp
7. Alternative sharing methods if WhatsApp URL scheme fails:
   - Direct clipboard copy with success notification
   - Native share sheet integration (iOS/Android)
   - SMS sharing with formatted text
   - Email sharing with HTML formatted message
8. URL scheme validation and error handling with user guidance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.5 (Epic 3 Scope Rollback), the LiveGameScreen has been simplified and SettlementService reduced to core functionality. This WhatsApp integration should build on the simplified settlement calculations without adding complex scope creep.

### Data Models
Based on architecture/data-models.md:
- **Settlement Data Structure**: Use existing `OptimizedSettlement` interface from SettlementService
- **Session Model**: Access session.name, session.totalPot for message formatting [Source: architecture/data-models.md#session-model]
- **Player Model**: Use player.name, player.totalBuyIns, player.totalCashOuts for message content [Source: architecture/data-models.md#player-model]
- **Transaction Model**: May reference transaction.type and transaction.amount for detailed breakdown [Source: architecture/data-models.md#transaction-model]

### API Specifications
Based on architecture/external-apis.md and architecture/components.md:
- **WhatsApp URL Scheme**: Use `whatsapp://send?text={encoded_message}` format [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#whatsapp-url-scheme-integration]
- **No Authentication Required**: WhatsApp URL schemes work without API keys [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#whatsapp-url-scheme-integration]
- **WhatsAppIntegration Component**: Should implement `shareToWhatsApp(message: string): Promise<ShareResult>` interface [Source: architecture/components.md#whatsappintegration-component]

### Component Specifications
Based on architecture/frontend-architecture.md and architecture/components.md:
- **WhatsAppShare Component**: Should be placed in `src/screens/Settlement/` directory following route organization [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-organization]
- **Settlement Screen Integration**: Modify existing `SettlementScreen.tsx` to include sharing functionality [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#screens]
- **UI Components**: Use shadcn/ui Button and Card components for consistency [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]

- **Component Testing**: Test user interactions and sharing workflows [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests-90-coverage-target]

### Technical Constraints
Based on architecture/coding-standards.md and architecture/tech-stack.md:
- **Error Handling**: Use ServiceError class for consistent error handling [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **State Management**: Use Zustand store actions, avoid direct state mutation [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, define shared types in `src/types/` [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **React Native APIs**: Use React Native Linking for URL schemes, Clipboard for fallback [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

## Testing
