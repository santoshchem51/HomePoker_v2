## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4 QR Code Session Join, the foundation includes:
- SessionService integration for session data access and player management
- Existing Player interface with profileId field for profile linking
- AsyncStorage patterns established for local data persistence
- Testing framework patterns for service and component validation

### Simplified Player Profile Data Structure
**Basic PlayerProfile Interface** [Source: DatabaseService.ts PlayerProfile]
- Location: src/types/profile.ts
- Simple structure with only essential fields: name and preferredBuyIn
- Integration with existing Player interface via profileId field
- AsyncStorage optimization for mobile local storage

**Simplified Profile Structure:**
```typescript
export interface PlayerProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  preferredBuyIn: number;
  lastPlayedAt?: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

export interface ProfileData {
  name: string;
  preferredBuyIn: number;
}
```

### ProfileService Architecture
**Basic Local Storage Management Service**
- Location: src/services/core/ProfileService.ts
- Technology: AsyncStorage for React Native local storage
- Singleton pattern following existing SessionService patterns
- Integration with existing DatabaseService patterns for consistency

**ProfileService Core Methods:**
```typescript
export class ProfileService {
  // Basic CRUD Operations
  createProfile(profileData: ProfileData): Promise<PlayerProfile>
  updateProfile(id: string, updates: Partial<ProfileData>): Promise<PlayerProfile>
  getProfile(id: string): Promise<PlayerProfile | null>
  deleteProfile(id: string): Promise<void>
  
  // Simple Search and Recent Players
  searchProfilesByName(query: string): Promise<PlayerProfile[]>
  getRecentProfiles(limit: number): Promise<PlayerProfile[]>
  
  // Basic Integration
  linkPlayerToProfile(playerId: string, profileId: string): Promise<void>
}
```

### Quick Player Selection Interface
**Simple Player Selection Component**
- Location: src/components/profile/QuickPlayerSelection.tsx
- Shows recent 6 players maximum
- Simple search by name functionality
- Integration with existing touch interface patterns from Story 2.3

**Simplified Component Architecture:**
```typescript
export interface QuickPlayerSelectionProps {
  onPlayerSelect: (player: Player | ProfileData) => void;
  sessionId: string;
  showGuestOption: boolean;
}

export interface PlayerSelectionCard {
  type: 'profile' | 'guest';
  profile?: PlayerProfile;
  guestData?: { name: string };
  isRecent: boolean;
}
```

### Profile Creation Workflow
**Simple Profile Creation Flow**
- Basic profile creation form with name and buy-in only
- Integration with existing SessionService.addPlayer workflow
- No photo handling complexity

**Profile Creation Form Design:**
- Location: src/components/profile/ProfileCreationForm.tsx
- Simple form with name and buy-in fields
- Basic validation following existing validation patterns
- Integration with existing touch interface styling

### File Locations and Project Structure
**Component Locations**
- ProfileCreationForm.tsx → src/components/profile/ProfileCreationForm.tsx
- QuickPlayerSelection.tsx → src/components/profile/QuickPlayerSelection.tsx

**Service Locations**
- ProfileService.ts → src/services/core/ProfileService.ts

**Type Locations**
- profile.ts → src/types/profile.ts

### Technology Stack Integration
**AsyncStorage for Local Profile Storage**
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage for persistent local storage
- JSON serialization for profile data storage
- Simple CRUD operations using existing patterns

### Integration with Existing Components
**SessionService Integration**
- Extend addPlayer method to support profile-based player creation
- Profile linking during session player addition
- Integration with existing player validation and session management

**Basic SessionService Methods:**
```typescript
// Basic player addition with profile support
addPlayerFromProfile(sessionId: string, profileId: string): Promise<Player>
addGuestPlayer(sessionId: string, guestData: PlayerData): Promise<Player>
```

### Guest vs Saved Player Flow
**Simple Player Type Management**
- Clear distinction between guest and saved players
- Guest player quick-add with minimal required information
- Existing isGuest flag integration in Player interface

**Flow Distinctions:**
1. **Guest Player Flow:**
   - Quick name entry and session join
   - isGuest: true flag set in Player record

2. **Saved Player Flow:**
   - Profile selection from quick-select interface
   - Profile data pre-fills player information
   - Profile usage tracking and last played updates

### Error Handling and Validation
**Basic Profile Data Validation**
- Name validation (1-50 characters)
- Preferred buy-in validation (positive number)
- Duplicate name detection

**Error Recovery Patterns:**
- Profile creation retry mechanisms for storage failures
- Graceful degradation when AsyncStorage unavailable
