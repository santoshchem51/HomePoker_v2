# Story 1.3: Buy-in Transaction Recording

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - 2025-08-12

## Story
**As a** poker player,
**I want** to record when I buy into the game for a specific dollar amount,
**so that** my contribution to the pot is tracked accurately throughout the session.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Buy-in entry interface accepts player selection and dollar amount
2. Transaction timestamp automatically recorded with each buy-in
3. Player running total updates immediately after buy-in entry
4. Buy-in history displays all transactions for session with timestamps
5. Input validation prevents negative amounts and enforces reasonable limits ($5-$500)
6. Simple undo functionality for last transaction entered within 30 seconds

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion, key learnings relevant to this story:
- ✅ **SessionService and database foundation COMPLETE** - Full session management with player tracking already exists
- ✅ **DatabaseService.executeTransaction()** - ACID transaction support available for multi-step operations
- ✅ **sessionStore.ts with Zustand** - State management patterns established for session data
- **IMPORTANT**: All database operations must use transaction boundaries to ensure financial data consistency

### Data Models
**Transaction Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#transaction-model]
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  playerId: string;
  type: 'buy_in' | 'cash_out';
  amount: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  method: 'voice' | 'manual';
  isVoided: boolean;
  description?: string;
}
```

**Player Model Updates** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#player-model]
```typescript
interface Player {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  name: string;
  isGuest: boolean;
  profileId?: string;
  currentBalance: number;        // Updated by transactions
  totalBuyIns: number;          // Incremented by buy-ins
  totalCashOuts: number;        // Updated later by cash-outs
  status: 'active' | 'cashed_out';
  joinedAt: Date;
}
```

### Database Schema Requirements
**Transactions Table** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#sqlite-schema-definition]
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    player_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES players(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    type TEXT CHECK(type IN ('buy_in', 'cash_out')) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK(amount > 0),
    timestamp DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    method TEXT CHECK(method IN ('voice', 'manual')) NOT NULL,
    is_voided BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    description TEXT,
    
    -- Audit fields
    created_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    voided_at DATETIME,
    void_reason TEXT,
    
    -- Performance indexes
    INDEX idx_transactions_session ON transactions(session_id, timestamp),
    INDEX idx_transactions_player ON transactions(player_id, timestamp),
    INDEX idx_transactions_type ON transactions(session_id, type),
    INDEX idx_transactions_active ON transactions(session_id, is_voided, timestamp)
);
```

### Component Specifications
**TransactionProcessor Component** [Source: architecture/components.md#transactionprocessor-component]
- `recordBuyIn(playerId: string, amount: number, method: TransactionMethod): Promise<Transaction>` - Process buy-in transaction
- `calculatePlayerBalance(playerId: string): Promise<PlayerBalance>` - Real-time balance computation
- Dependencies: SessionManager for session validation, DatabaseService for transaction persistence
- Technology Stack: TypeScript business logic with React Query for optimistic updates, SQLite transactions for data integrity

### File Locations
**Component File Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- `src/services/core/TransactionService.ts` - Transaction business logic service
- `src/screens/LiveGame/TransactionForm.tsx` - Buy-in entry form component
- `src/components/poker/TransactionHistory.tsx` - Transaction display component
- `src/components/poker/UndoButton.tsx` - Undo functionality component
- `src/stores/transactionStore.ts` - Transaction state management (or extend sessionStore.ts)
- `src/types/transaction.ts` - Transaction-related TypeScript type definitions
- `src/utils/undo-manager.ts` - Undo functionality utility

### Technical Constraints
**Service Layer Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Never bypass service layer - all database operations must go through DatabaseService
- All multi-step database operations (buy-in + player balance update) must use `DatabaseService.executeTransaction()` with proper rollback
- All service methods must use consistent ServiceError class with proper error codes
- Financial calculations must use `CalculationUtils.addAmounts()` for currency precision

**State Management Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Never mutate Zustand store state directly - use store actions that maintain immutability
- Type Sharing: Always define shared types in `src/types/` and import consistently

**Financial Precision Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Always use `CalculationUtils.addAmounts()`, `CalculationUtils.subtractAmounts()` for currency math
- Prevent floating-point precision errors in financial calculations
- Input validation through `ValidationService` before processing

### Business Rules and Validation
**Transaction Validation Requirements**
- Buy-in amounts must be between $5.00 and $500.00
- Only allow buy-ins for active sessions (status = 'active')
- Only allow buy-ins for players with status = 'active'
- Prevent duplicate transactions (same player, same amount within 5 seconds)
- All amounts must be positive and have maximum 2 decimal places

### Workflow Integration
**Buy-in Recording Workflow** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-2-voice-enabled-transaction-recording]
1. User inputs buy-in via TransactionForm (player selection + amount)
2. TransactionService.recordBuyIn() called with playerId, amount, method='manual'
3. Database transaction: BEGIN
4. INSERT into transactions table
5. UPDATE player total_buy_ins and current_balance
6. UPDATE session total_pot
7. Database transaction: COMMIT
8. Store state updated with new transaction and balances
9. UI shows success feedback and updated player balance
