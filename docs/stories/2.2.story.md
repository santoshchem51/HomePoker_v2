## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 Voice Recognition Infrastructure Setup, the foundation includes:
- VoiceService singleton with startListening()/stopListening() methods operational
- voiceStore using Zustand for voice recognition state management
- VoiceCommandPanel component with button-triggered voice activation
- Comprehensive error handling with ServiceError class and proper error codes
- 500ms timeout enforcement for voice processing performance
- @react-native-voice/voice package integrated with iOS and Android permissions

### Voice Command Processing Requirements
**VoiceCommandParser Service** [Source: architecture/components.md#voicecommandhandler-component]
- Location: src/services/integration/VoiceCommandParser.ts
- Singleton pattern consistent with VoiceService and other integration services
- Key interfaces:
  - `parsePlayerName(voiceInput: string, sessionPlayers: Player[]): Promise<PlayerMatchResult>` - Match spoken names to session roster
  - `parseAmount(voiceInput: string): Promise<AmountParseResult>` - Convert spoken numbers to currency amounts
  - `parseCommand(voiceInput: string, context: SessionContext): Promise<CommandResult>` - Full command interpretation
- Dependencies: SessionService for player roster, ValidationService for input validation
- Error handling: ServiceError class with voice-specific error codes

**Command Structure Patterns** [Source: prd.md Story 2.2 AC]
- Primary pattern: "Add [Player Name] [Amount]" (e.g., "Add John fifty dollars")
- Player name variations: Full names, nicknames, first names only
- Amount variations: Written numbers ("fifty"), digits ("50"), combinations ("five zero")
- Confidence threshold: 0.7 minimum for automatic processing
- Below threshold: Manual confirmation dialog required

### Number Recognition Implementation
**Supported Number Formats** [Source: prd.md Story 2.2 AC]
- Written numbers: "twenty", "fifty", "one hundred"
- Digit recognition: "20", "50", "100"
- Combination patterns: "five zero" (50), "one zero zero" (100)
- Dollar amount handling: "fifty dollars", "50 bucks", "twenty"
- Range validation: Typical poker buy-in amounts ($5-$500)

**Common Poker Buy-in Amount Examples:**
- Small stakes: $5, $10, $20 ("five", "ten", "twenty")
- Medium stakes: $25, $50, $100 ("twenty five", "fifty", "one hundred")
- High stakes: $200, $500 ("two hundred", "five hundred")

**Parser Logic Requirements**
- Normalize spoken text to standard formats
- Handle common speech recognition errors (homophones)
- Validate amounts against session buy-in rules
- Map written numbers to numeric values using lookup tables
- Support common poker terminology and slang

### Player Name Matching Strategy
**Fuzzy Matching Algorithm** [Source: architecture/components.md#voicecommandhandler-component]
- Use string similarity scoring (Levenshtein distance or similar)
- Match against active session player roster from SessionService
- Handle nickname variations and common name abbreviations
- Minimum similarity threshold for confident matches
- Disambiguation flow for multiple similar matches

**Player Context Integration** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#player-model]
- Access current session players via SessionService.getSessionState()
- Player objects contain: id, name, isGuest, profileId
- Match against both profile names and session-specific names
- Consider recently active players for better matching accuracy

### File Locations and Project Structure
**Service Location** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- VoiceCommandParser.ts → src/services/integration/VoiceCommandParser.ts
- Follows integration service pattern alongside VoiceService.ts, WhatsAppService.ts

- Audio confirmation of successful buy-in transactions
- Voice prompts for clarification when commands are ambiguous

**State Management** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Zustand 4.4+ for voice command state management
- Extend existing voiceStore with buy-in command states
- Pattern: command parsing results, confirmation states, error handling

### Service Integration Requirements
**SessionService Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#sessionmanager-component]
- Access active session player roster via `getSessionState(sessionId: string)`
- Validate player exists in current session before processing buy-in
- Integration point: VoiceCommandParser calls SessionService for player validation

**TransactionService Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#transactionprocessor-component]
- Record buy-in via `recordBuyIn(playerId: string, amount: number, method: 'voice')`
- Transaction method field set to 'voice' for voice-initiated transactions
- Integration point: VoiceCommandHandler calls TransactionService after confirmation

**ValidationService Integration** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- All user input validated through ValidationService before processing
- Amount validation for poker buy-in ranges and session rules
- Player name validation against session roster and business rules

### Error Handling and Fallback Requirements
**Service Error Integration** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Voice-specific error codes: VOICE_COMMAND_AMBIGUOUS, PLAYER_NOT_FOUND, AMOUNT_PARSE_FAILED
- Confidence threshold failures: VOICE_CONFIDENCE_TOO_LOW
- Graceful degradation to manual input when voice parsing fails

**Confirmation Dialog Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- All voice-initiated financial transactions require visual confirmation dialog
- Display parsed player name and amount for user verification
- Allow manual correction of parsed values before transaction processing
- Cancel option to abort voice command and return to listening state

**UI Confirmation Dialog Specifications:**
- Modal dialog with poker-themed styling (dark background, green accents)
- Large, clear text showing: "Add buy-in for [Player Name]: $[Amount]?"
- Two primary action buttons: "Confirm" (green) and "Cancel" (gray)
- Edit button allowing manual correction of player name or amount
- Visual confidence indicator if below 0.7 threshold ("Voice recognition uncertain")

### Performance Requirements
**Processing Speed** [Source: prd.md NFR1]
- Voice command processing within 500ms established in Story 2.1
- Parser logic must complete within timeout constraints
- Async player lookup and amount parsing optimized for performance

**Confidence Scoring** [Source: prd.md Story 2.2 AC]
- 0.7 (70%) minimum confidence threshold for automatic processing
- Below threshold triggers manual confirmation workflow
- Confidence calculation based on voice recognition accuracy and parser certainty

### Voice Data Privacy and Security
**Voice Data Handling** [Enhancement for privacy compliance]
- Voice audio processed locally on device only (no network transmission)
- Temporary audio buffers cleared immediately after processing
- No persistent storage of voice recordings or audio data
- Voice processing complies with device privacy settings and permissions

**Audio Security Measures** [Enhancement for data protection]
- Voice commands processed within 500ms timeout to minimize exposure
- Failed recognition attempts do not store partial audio data
- Voice confidence scores calculated without retaining raw audio
- Background app suspension immediately terminates voice processing
