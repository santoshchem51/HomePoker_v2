## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6 (WhatsApp Integration):
- MessageQueue service already implements background processing patterns that can be reused for cleanup scheduling
- Database transaction patterns established in WhatsAppService.optimizeSettlements() should be followed for cleanup operations
- Notification patterns from WhatsAppShare component can guide cleanup warning UI
- Export functionality partially exists in WhatsAppService - can be extended for full data export

### Data Models
**Session Model Extensions** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
interface Session {
  // Existing fields...
  cleanup_at?: Date;      // Scheduled cleanup time (completedAt + 10 hours)
  exported_at?: Date;     // Timestamp of last export
  export_format?: string; // Format of last export (json, csv, whatsapp)
}
```

### Database Schema Updates
**Schema Changes Required** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Note: The sessions table already includes cleanup_at (line 25), exported_at (line 26), export_format (line 27), and warning_sent (line 28) columns in the base schema. The notification_queue and scheduled_tasks tables are also defined in the schema (lines 91-120).

If migrating existing database, use:
```sql
-- Migration for existing sessions table (if columns don't exist)
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN exported_at DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN export_format TEXT;
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN warning_sent BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;
```

### Technical Implementation Details

**Background Task Implementation** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#background-task-and-scheduling-patterns]
- Use setInterval pattern with 1-hour interval for cleanup checks (following MessageQueue.ts:154 pattern)
- Implement AppState monitoring for app lifecycle handling
- Follow ScheduledTaskService pattern from architecture documentation
- Store scheduled tasks in SQLite scheduled_tasks table for persistence

**Notification Implementation** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#notification-system-architecture]
- Use Alert.alert() for immediate notifications when app is active (following WhatsAppShare.tsx:61 pattern)
- Queue notifications in SQLite notification_queue table when app is inactive
- Show queued notifications on app launch via checkPendingNotifications()
- No external push notification libraries required

**Data Deletion Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All deletions must use DatabaseService.executeTransaction() for atomicity
- Cascade delete all related records (players, transactions)
- Use VACUUM command after bulk deletions to reclaim storage space
- Log all deletions for audit purposes

**Database Tables Required** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- notification_queue table for deferred notifications (lines 91-104)
- scheduled_tasks table for task persistence (lines 106-120)
- sessions table updates: warning_sent column (line 28)

**Export Formats**
- JSON: Complete session data with all transactions and player details
- CSV: Simplified tabular format for spreadsheet import
- WhatsApp: Leverage existing WhatsAppService formatting

**Privacy Compliance**
- Complete data removal after 10 hours ensures no long-term data retention
- Export functionality allows users to retain their own data
- No cloud storage or external data transmission
