# Story 1.2: Basic Session Creation and Management

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - 2025-08-12

## Story
**As a** poker game organizer,
**I want** to create a new poker session and add players to track throughout the night,
**so that** I can start organizing money tracking before the game begins.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Session creation form accepts session name and organizer information
2. Player addition interface allows adding 4-8 players with names (no accounts required)
3. Session displays current player list with ability to add/remove players before game starts
4. Each session generates unique session ID for later reference
5. Session data persists locally with SQLite storage
6. Basic session status tracking (created, active, completed)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion, key learnings relevant to this story:
- ✅ **DatabaseService foundation is COMPLETE** - Full SQLite implementation with sessions, players tables already exists
- ✅ **Schema is implemented** - Complete database schema with proper indexing and foreign keys established
- ✅ **Transaction support** - DatabaseService.executeTransaction() method available for ACID compliance
- TypeScript strict mode configuration is operational
- Testing framework is set up with React Native Testing Library
- Project structure follows unified-project-structure patterns

**IMPORTANT**: Story 1.1 has already delivered the complete database foundation that satisfies all Story 1.5 requirements. No additional database setup is needed.

### Data Models
**Session Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#session-model]
```typescript
interface Session {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  organizerId: string;
  status: 'created' | 'active' | 'completed';
  createdAt: Date;
  startedAt?: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  totalPot: number;
  playerCount: number;
}
```

**Player Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#player-model]
```typescript
interface Player {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  name: string;
  isGuest: boolean;
  profileId?: string;
  currentBalance: number;
  totalBuyIns: number;
  totalCashOuts: number;
  status: 'active' | 'cashed_out';
  joinedAt: Date;
}
```

### Database Schema Requirements
**Sessions Table** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#sqlite-schema-definition]
```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    organizer_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('created', 'active', 'completed')) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'created',
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    started_at DATETIME,
    completed_at DATETIME,
    total_pot DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
    player_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    cleanup_at DATETIME,
    
    -- Performance indexes
    INDEX idx_sessions_status ON sessions(status),
    INDEX idx_sessions_cleanup ON sessions(cleanup_at),
    INDEX idx_sessions_created ON sessions(created_at)
);
```

**Players Table** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#sqlite-schema-definition]
```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_guest BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    profile_id TEXT REFERENCES player_profiles(id),
    current_balance DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
    total_buy_ins DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
    total_cash_outs DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
    status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('active', 'cashed_out')) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
    joined_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Performance indexes
    INDEX idx_players_session ON players(session_id),
    INDEX idx_players_profile ON players(profile_id),
    INDEX idx_players_status ON players(session_id, status)
);
```

### Component Specifications
**SessionManager Component** [Source: architecture/components.md#sessionmanager-component]
- `createSession(name: string): Promise<Session>` - Initialize new poker night session
- `addPlayer(sessionId: string, playerData: PlayerData): Promise<Player>` - Add participant to session
- `getSessionState(sessionId: string): Promise<SessionState>` - Retrieve current session status and players
- Dependencies: DatabaseService for persistence, inline validation for business rules
- Technology Stack: TypeScript service class with Zustand state management, SQLite integration

**React Native Components Needed** [Source: epic file requirements]
- `CreateSessionScreen.tsx` - Main session creation screen
- `SessionForm.tsx` - Form for session details
- `PlayerList.tsx` - Display and manage players
- `AddPlayerModal.tsx` - Modal for adding new players

### File Locations
**Component File Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- `src/screens/SessionSetup/CreateSessionScreen.tsx` - Main session creation screen
- `src/screens/SessionSetup/PlayerManagement.tsx` - Player list management
- `src/components/poker/PlayerCard.tsx` - Individual player display cards
- `src/services/core/SessionService.ts` - Session business logic service
- `src/stores/sessionStore.ts` - Zustand session state management
- `src/types/session.ts` - Session-related TypeScript type definitions
- `src/types/player.ts` - Player-related TypeScript type definitions

### Technical Constraints
**Service Layer Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Never bypass service layer - all database operations must go through DatabaseService
- All multi-step database operations must use `DatabaseService.executeTransaction()` with proper rollback
- Input validation must be handled within service methods (ValidationService not yet implemented)
- All service methods must use consistent ServiceError class with proper error codes

**State Management Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Never mutate Zustand store state directly - use store actions that maintain immutability
- Type Sharing: Always define shared types in `src/types/` and import consistently across components and services

**Naming Conventions** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- Components: PascalCase (PlayerCard.tsx, CreateSessionScreen.tsx)
- Services: PascalCase classes (SessionService.ts)
- Database Tables: snake_case (sessions, players)
- Database Columns: snake_case (session_id, created_at, player_count)
- Store Actions: camelCase (addTransaction, updatePlayerBalance)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (MAX_PLAYERS_PER_SESSION)

### Performance Requirements
**Database Performance** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- SQLite configured with WAL mode and performance optimizations
- Proper indexing on sessions(status), players(session_id), and other frequently queried columns
- Foreign key constraints enabled for data integrity

### Session Creation Workflow
**Core Workflow Pattern** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-1-session-creation-and-player-onboarding]
1. User creates new poker session through UI
2. SessionManager.createSession() called with name and organizerId
3. Database INSERT into sessions table
4. Session object returned to UI
5. Loop: Add 4-8 players via SessionManager.addPlayer()
6. Each player INSERT into players table
7. Session ready for activation
