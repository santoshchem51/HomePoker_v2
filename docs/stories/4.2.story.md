# Story 4.2: Settlement Message Formatting

## Status  
**Done** âœ… 

## Story
**As a** poker group member,
**I want** settlement messages that are clear and easy to read on mobile,
**so that** I can quickly understand who owes what without confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Settlement summary formatted for mobile readability
2. Clear display of who owes whom with amounts
3. Total pot size and session duration included
4. Emoji-enhanced formatting for visual appeal
5. Player buy-in/cash-out breakdown included
6. Professional formatting that works across all WhatsApp clients

### Architecture Requirements
- Follow service layer pattern - extend `WhatsAppService` for formatting logic
- Use shared types from `src/types/` for consistency
- Apply financial precision rules with `CalculationUtils` for amount display
