### React Native Appearance API Integration
**Theme Management Architecture** [Technology: React Native Appearance API]
- Location: src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx
- System integration using React Native's Appearance API for automatic dark mode detection
- Manual override capability with toggle component for user preference
- AsyncStorage persistence following existing ProfileService patterns

**ThemeContext Implementation:**
```typescript
export interface ThemeContextValue {
  isDarkMode: boolean;
  currentTheme: 'dark' | 'light' | 'auto';
  toggleTheme: () => void;
  setTheme: (theme: 'dark' | 'light' | 'auto') => void;
  brightness: number;
  setBrightness: (brightness: number) => void;
}

export const useTheme = () => {
  const context = useContext(ThemeContext);
  // Automatic system integration with manual override
  const systemColorScheme = useColorScheme();
  const effectiveTheme = context.currentTheme === 'auto' ? systemColorScheme : context.currentTheme;
}
```

  highContrastText: '#FFFFFF', // Pure white for critical information
  
  // Chip colors with enhanced visibility
  redChip: '#E74C3C', // Enhanced red with warm undertone
  greenChip: '#27AE60', // Enhanced green maintaining poker aesthetics
  blackChip: '#34495E', // Warm dark gray instead of pure black
  goldChip: '#F1C40F', // Warm gold for premium actions
  
  // Status indicators with high contrast
  active: '#2ECC71', // Bright green for active players
  selected: '#F39C12', // Warm orange for selections
  error: '#E74C3C', // Clear red for errors
  warning: '#F39C12', // Amber warning color
  success: '#27AE60', // Clear green for success states
  
  // Brightness overlay system
  brightnessOverlay: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)', // Transparent to opaque black for brightness control
} as const;
```

### Independent Brightness Control System
**Manual Brightness Management** [Component: BrightnessControl.tsx]
- Location: src/components/common/BrightnessControl.tsx
- Overlay-based brightness reduction independent of device system settings
- Poker-optimized presets: Dim (0.3x), Medium (0.6x), Bright (1.0x)
- Real-time adjustment with slider interface and immediate visual feedback

**Brightness Control Implementation:**
```typescript
export interface BrightnessControlProps {
  currentBrightness: number;
  onBrightnessChange: (brightness: number) => void;
  showPresets?: boolean;
}

// Brightness overlay applied to root container
export const BrightnessOverlay = ({ brightness }: { brightness: number }) => (
  <View 
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0,
      backgroundColor: `rgba(0, 0, 0, ${1 - brightness})`,
      pointerEvents: 'none',
      zIndex: 1000,
    }}
  />
);
```

### Distance Visibility Optimization
**Enhanced Typography and Touch Targets** [Source: Enhanced touchInterface.styles.ts]
- Minimum font sizes: Balances 24pt, Actions 20pt, Critical text 18pt
- Touch targets increased to 88pt minimum for 2-3 feet interaction distance
- High contrast backgrounds behind all critical text elements
- Bold font weights for improved legibility in dim lighting

**Distance-Optimized Typography:**
```typescript
export const DarkDistanceStyles = StyleSheet.create({
  criticalBalance: {
    fontSize: 24, // Large enough for 2-3 feet viewing
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: DarkPokerColors.highContrastText,
    backgroundColor: DarkPokerColors.tableGreen,
    padding: 8,
    borderRadius: 4,
  },
  actionButton: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    minHeight: 88, // Accessibility compliant touch target
    minWidth: 88,
    backgroundColor: DarkPokerColors.goldChip,
    color: DarkPokerColors.background,
  },
  playerStatus: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: '600',
    color: DarkPokerColors.primaryText,
  },
});
```

### Color-Blind Accessibility Implementation
**Shape and Pattern-Based Indicators** [Component: AccessibleIndicators.tsx]
- Location: src/components/common/AccessibleIndicators.tsx
- Unique shapes for chip denominations: Circle ($5), Square ($25), Diamond ($100)
- Pattern textures for player states: Solid (active), Striped (waiting), Dotted (cashed out)
- Icon integration alongside color coding for all interactive elements

**Shape-Based Chip Indicators:**
```typescript
export const ChipShapeIndicator = ({ value, size = 44 }: ChipShapeProps) => {
  const getChipShape = (chipValue: number) => {
    switch(chipValue) {
      case 5: return 'circle'; // Red $5 chips
      case 25: return 'square'; // Green $25 chips  
      case 100: return 'diamond'; // Black $100 chips
      default: return 'circle';
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <View style={[
      styles.chipContainer,
      { backgroundColor: getChipColor(value) }
    ]}>
      <ChipShape shape={getChipShape(value)} size={size * 0.6} />
      <Text style={styles.chipText}>${value}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

### Battery Conservation Animation Strategy
**Minimal Animation Design** [Strategy: Static UI with Essential Transitions Only]
- Replace complex animations with simple 200ms opacity transitions
- Disable celebratory animations and micro-interactions for poker focus
- Static UI states with clear visual feedback using color and shape changes
- Optional animation toggle for complete battery optimization in long poker sessions

**Minimal Animation Styles:**
```typescript
export const MinimalAnimationStyles = StyleSheet.create({
  staticTransition: {
    // No transform animations, opacity only
    transition: 'opacity 200ms ease-in-out',
  },
  pressedState: {
    opacity: 0.8, // Simple opacity change instead of scale transform
  },
  selectedState: {
    backgroundColor: DarkPokerColors.selected,
    // No glow or shadow animations
  },
});
```

  const effectiveTheme = useMemo(() => {
    if (userPreference === 'auto') {
      return systemScheme || 'light';
    }
    return userPreference;
  }, [systemScheme, userPreference]);
  
  return { effectiveTheme, userPreference, setUserPreference };
};
```
