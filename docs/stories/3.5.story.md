# Story 3.5: Epic 3 Scope Rollback and Code Elimination

## Status  
**DONE** - QA Approved

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to systematically remove Epic 3 scope creep and restore focus to core settlement calculations,
**so that** Epic 3 can be properly validated and completed within MVP scope.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Remove 6,000+ lines of scope creep code from Epic 3 implementation
2. Rollback LiveGameScreen to Epic 1's simple transaction entry version
3. Eliminate all PDF export infrastructure and complex validation systems
4. Simplify SettlementService to core calculation methods only
5. Remove 2 external dependencies (react-native-html-to-pdf, react-native-share)
6. Epic 3 reduced to original PRD scope with visual validation capability

## Business Context
Epic 3 experienced massive scope creep, expanding from simple settlement calculations to enterprise-grade systems with PDF export, cryptographic verification, and complex UI components. This rollback restores Epic 3 to its original PRD intent and enables proper MVP delivery.

## Scope Rollback Breakdown
- **Original Epic 3 Estimate:** 4 focused stories, ~1,500 lines of code
- **Current Implementation:** 10+ complex systems, ~6,000+ lines of code  
- **Target Post-Rollback:** Core settlement calculations only, ~1,800 lines of code

## Development Notes
This story represents a systematic restoration of Epic 3 to its original PRD intent. The goal is not to lose functionality, but to remove unnecessary complexity that prevents proper validation and completion.

**Key Principle:** Preserve core settlement calculation value while eliminating enterprise-grade features that belong in post-MVP development.

**Success Metric:** Epic 3 can be visually validated and marked "Done" within 1-2 weeks after this rollback is completed.
