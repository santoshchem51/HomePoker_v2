# PokePot Product Requirements Document (PRD) v2.0

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Transform chaotic WhatsApp money tracking into streamlined, dispute-free poker night experience
- Eliminate 15-20 minute settlement calculations through automated optimization algorithms  
- Reduce settlement disputes from 70% to under 10% through transparent, reliable tracking
- Preserve and enhance social group dynamics via seamless WhatsApp integration
- Enable instant early cash-out calculations for mid-game departures
- Create entertaining poker night amplifier that groups actively request for future games

### Background Context

Home poker players currently rely on scattered WhatsApp messages to track buy-ins and settlements, creating organizational chaos that intensifies over 3-4 hour sessions. Critical financial information becomes buried in hundreds of chat messages between game commentary and social banter, with unclear shorthand like "same" or "+1" becoming impossible to decode during final settlements.

PokePot addresses this by becoming the invisible infrastructure that makes home poker nights run smoothly - similar to how Venmo simplified splitting restaurant bills. The solution leverages existing WhatsApp group dynamics rather than replacing them, using local data management and easy sharing to transform necessary tracking into entertainment enhancement.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
PokePot embraces a **"game night companion"** design philosophy - the interface should feel like a helpful friend who handles the boring math while staying out of the way during actual poker play. The visual design prioritizes **large, poker-friendly touch targets** optimized for use during games when hands might be holding cards or chips. Dark mode default reduces screen glare that could give away hand information, while maintaining the social warmth that groups expect from their poker nights.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
**Voice-First, Touch-Secondary:** Primary interactions happen through voice commands with visual confirmations, allowing players to keep hands free during active play. **One-Tap Critical Actions** for buy-ins and cash-outs minimize interaction complexity. **Ambient Information Display** shows key data (current balances, session time) without requiring active attention, similar to a poker chip rack that you glance at occasionally.

### Core Screens and Views
- **Session Setup Screen:** Local session creation and player onboarding hub
- **Live Game Dashboard:** Real-time balance display with voice command interface  
- **Buy-in/Cash-out Interface:** Large button interactions with voice confirmation
- **Settlement Summary Screen:** Final optimization results with WhatsApp sharing
- **Player Management Screen:** Saved profiles and session history access

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Committed to WCAG AA compliance focusing on **high contrast ratios** for poker room lighting conditions, **large text sizes** readable from normal playing distance, and **voice navigation** as primary accessibility feature. Color coding includes shape/pattern alternatives for color-blind users, with audio cues supplementing visual feedback.

### Branding
**"Sophisticated Poker Room"** aesthetic combining the elegance of casino environments with the warmth of home game social settings. Deep greens and rich golds evoke traditional poker felt and chips, while modern typography maintains mobile-first usability. **Humor personality integration** allows visual themes to shift based on selected voice character (Vegas Dealer gets more neon, Drunk Uncle gets more casual styling).

### Target Device and Platforms: Mobile Native
**Mobile-first design** optimized for iOS and Android phones held in portrait mode during gameplay, with tablet landscape support for dedicated "app keeper" devices. Native React Native implementation enables installation through app stores while maintaining native-like performance for voice recognition and local database operations.

## Technical Assumptions

### Architecture: Monolithic Mobile Application
**Rationale:** Following ADR-001 (Complete Backend Elimination), PokePot uses a monolithic mobile architecture with local SQLite storage. This eliminates network dependencies, reduces complexity, and ensures 100% offline functionality for MVP delivery.

### Repository Structure: Single Repository  
**Rationale:** Simplified single-repository structure for mobile-only application reduces deployment complexity and enables faster MVP iteration without backend coordination overhead.

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Local Integration + **MANDATORY Visual Validation**
**Rationale:** Focus testing on financial calculation accuracy, SQLite operations, and core user flows. Local database integration testing ensures data integrity without network complexity.

**CRITICAL:** As of Story 1.8, ALL stories MUST include comprehensive visual validation using the actual PokePotExpo React Native application. HTML mockups or non-native demonstrations are strictly prohibited. See `/docs/STORY_DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` for complete requirements.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Mobile Framework:** React Native with TypeScript for cross-platform MVP delivery. SQLite integration via react-native-sqlite-storage for local data persistence.

**Data Storage:** **Local SQLite database only** - eliminates backend dependencies, provides instant response times, and works completely offline. Session data automatically cleaned up after 10 hours per privacy requirements.

**Voice Recognition:** **On-device iOS/Android speech APIs first**, with fallback to manual input. Reduces external dependencies, improves response times, eliminates per-use API costs, and works completely offline.

**WhatsApp Integration (MVP):** **URL scheme approach with manual sharing** - users tap "Share to WhatsApp" button, WhatsApp opens with pre-filled message, user selects group and sends. No API setup required, works immediately, completely reliable.

**WhatsApp Integration (Post-MVP):** **WhatsApp Business API for automation** - planned for v2.0 to enable fully automated message posting to groups. Requires backend server reintroduction and business verification process.

**Infrastructure (MVP):** **None required** - mobile-only application with local storage eliminates all server infrastructure costs and complexity.

**Security Architecture:** Local SQLite encryption for session data, no network transmission of sensitive information, automatic data cleanup ensures privacy compliance.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
- **WhatsApp Backup Plan:** Manual share buttons and formatted text generation if WhatsApp unavailable
- **Voice Recognition Backup:** Touch interface remains fully functional when speech fails
- **Offline-First Architecture:** Core functionality works without internet, no sync needed
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Start with basic features, add complexity based on user feedback
