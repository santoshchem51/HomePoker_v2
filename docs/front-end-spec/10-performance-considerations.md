# 10. Performance Considerations

## 10.1 Local SQLite Optimization

**Target Performance Metrics:**
- 95% of queries complete within 100ms
- Database initialization under 500ms
- Memory usage for DB operations under 50MB
- Concurrent read/write support via WAL mode

**Implementation Strategy:**
```typescript
const initializeDatabase = async () => {
  const db = await SQLite.openDatabase({
    name: 'pokepot.db',
    location: 'default',
    createFromLocation: '~pokepot-schema.db'
  })
  
  // Enable WAL mode for performance
  await db.executeSql('PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;')
  await db.executeSql('PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;')
  await db.executeSql('PRAGMA cache_size=10000;')
  
  return db
}
```

## 10.2 React Native Performance

**Bundle Optimization:**
- Code splitting for non-critical components
- Image optimization with WebP format
- Font subsetting for reduced bundle size
- Tree shaking for unused shadcn components

**Runtime Performance:**
- Lazy loading for transaction history screens
- Virtual scrolling for large player lists
- Memoization for expensive settlement calculations
- Debounced voice input processing

## 10.3 Memory Management

**Target Metrics:**
- App startup time under 3 seconds
- Memory usage under 150MB during active sessions
- 60fps UI performance during animations
- Battery optimization for extended poker sessions
