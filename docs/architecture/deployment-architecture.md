# Deployment Architecture

Define deployment strategy based on React Native mobile platform and app store distribution:

## Deployment Strategy

**Frontend Deployment:**
- **Platform:** Apple App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android)
- **Build Command:** `npm run build:ios` and `npm run build:android`
- **Output Directory:** `ios/build/` and `android/app/build/outputs/`
- **CDN/Edge:** App stores handle global distribution and caching

**Backend Deployment:**
- **Platform:** Embedded within mobile application (no separate deployment)
- **Build Command:** Services bundled with React Native app build process
- **Deployment Method:** Code bundled into mobile app binary
