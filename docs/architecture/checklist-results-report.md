## Risk Assessment

### Top 3 Risks by Severity:

1. **MEDIUM RISK - Settlement Algorithm Performance**
   - **Issue:** 2-second calculation limit for complex scenarios not validated
   - **Mitigation:** Implement performance testing, consider native module optimization
   - **Timeline Impact:** 2-3 days for performance validation

2. **LOW RISK - Voice Recognition Accuracy**
   - **Issue:** 90% accuracy target in poker room conditions not validated
   - **Mitigation:** Environmental testing, noise cancellation research, manual fallbacks
   - **Timeline Impact:** 1-2 days for testing framework

3. **LOW RISK - SQLite Performance on Older Devices**
   - **Issue:** 100ms database operation target on minimum spec devices needs validation
   - **Mitigation:** Device-specific performance testing, optimization validation
   - **Timeline Impact:** 2-3 days for device testing

## Final Recommendation

**ARCHITECTURE APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION** âœ…

This architecture is exceptionally well-designed for PokePot's poker night money tracking requirements. The local-first, mobile-focused approach with comprehensive financial controls and user experience optimizations provides a solid foundation for AI-driven development.
