### Testing Familiarity
- [ ] Run test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Review test examples in `__tests__/`
- [ ] Understand testing strategy from `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- [ ] Run coverage report: `npm test -- --coverage`

## üõ† Development Skills

### Required Technologies
- [ ] **React Native** fundamentals
- [ ] **TypeScript** strict mode usage

- [ ] **Jest** testing framework
- [ ] **ESLint** code quality tools

### Financial Application Context
- [ ] Understand floating-point precision issues
- [ ] Learn `CalculationUtils` usage for currency math
- [ ] Review transaction atomicity requirements
- [ ] Study settlement calculation validation

### PokePot-Specific Patterns
- [ ] **Service Layer**: All business logic in services
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Shared types in `src/types/`
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Consistent `ServiceError` usage
- [ ] **Database**: Transaction-based operations
- [ ] **Validation**: Input validation through services

## üß™ First Development Task

### Practice Assignment
Create a simple service to demonstrate understanding:

- [ ] Create `src/services/ExampleService.ts`
- [ ] Implement singleton pattern
- [ ] Add database query method
- [ ] Include proper error handling
- [ ] Write unit tests in `__tests__/`
- [ ] Ensure TypeScript compliance
- [ ] Pass ESLint validation

### Code Review Process
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b onboarding/example-service`
- [ ] Implement the service
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Check code quality: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Submit PR for review
- [ ] Address feedback and learn from comments

## üìã Project Standards Verification

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode: No `any` types
- [ ] ESLint: Zero warnings/errors
- [ ] Tests: ‚â•90% coverage for critical paths
- [ ] Documentation: JSDoc for complex functions
- [ ] Imports: Use path mapping (`src/`)

### Financial Safety Checklist
- [ ] Currency calculations use `CalculationUtils`
- [ ] Database operations use transactions
- [ ] Input validation through `ValidationService`
- [ ] Error handling with proper codes
- [ ] No direct state mutation

### Performance Checklist
- [ ] Bundle size under 50MB
- [ ] App startup under 3 seconds
- [ ] Database init under 100ms
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] No memory leaks in components

## üö¶ CI/CD Understanding

### Pipeline Knowledge
- [ ] Review `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [ ] Understand testing requirements
- [ ] Know build process for Android/iOS
- [ ] Learn security scanning steps
- [ ] Understand release automation

### Local Pipeline Testing
- [ ] Run CI commands locally:
  - [ ] `npm ci`
  - [ ] `npm run typecheck`
  - [ ] `npm run lint`
  - [ ] `npm test -- --coverage`
- [ ] Build Android APK: `npm run build:android:debug`
- [ ] Verify health checks pass

## ü§ù Team Integration

### Communication Setup
- [ ] Join project Slack/Discord channels
- [ ] Set up meeting calendar access
- [ ] Understand sprint planning process
- [ ] Know who to ask for help

### Development Workflow

## üéØ Knowledge Verification

### Technical Quiz
Answer these questions to verify understanding:

1. **Database**: What SQLite optimizations are enabled in `DatabaseService`?
2. **Financial**: Why can't we use regular JavaScript math for currency?
3. **Testing**: What are the coverage requirements for different code types?
4. **Architecture**: What is the purpose of the service layer pattern?
5. **Performance**: What are the app startup time requirements?

### Practical Tasks
- [ ] Fix a TypeScript error intentionally introduced
- [ ] Add a new field to the health check display
