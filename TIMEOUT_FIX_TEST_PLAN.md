# Database Timeout Fix - Test Plan
**Date:** 2025-08-13  
**Objective:** Validate Production Hardening Phase 1 database timeout fixes work correctly

## 🎯 Test Objectives

1. **Verify 5-second timeout** prevents app hanging indefinitely
2. **Test error recovery UI** provides clear feedback and retry options  
3. **Validate crash reporting** captures initialization metrics
4. **Confirm production readiness** for database initialization

## 📋 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Database Initialization ✅
**Expected Behavior:**
- App starts and shows "⏳ Initializing PokePot..."
- Database initializes within < 100ms (normal case)
- App proceeds to main screen
- Crash reporting logs successful initialization time

**Test Steps:**
1. Launch app on Android
2. Observe loading screen
3. Time initialization duration
4. Verify app reaches main screen
5. Check console logs for performance metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Initialization completes under 100ms
- ✅ No error messages displayed
- ✅ App functional on main screen
- ✅ CrashReportingService logs startup time

### Scenario 2: Database Timeout Protection 🔄
**Expected Behavior:**
- App shows "⏳ Initializing PokePot..."
- After exactly 5 seconds, timeout error appears
- Clear error message: "Database initialization is taking longer than expected"
- "Try Again" button available for retry

**Test Steps:**
1. Simulate slow database (modify timeout for testing)
2. Launch app and wait
3. Observe 5-second timeout
4. Check error message clarity
5. Test retry functionality

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Timeout occurs at exactly 5 seconds
- ✅ Clear, user-friendly error message
- ✅ Retry button functional
- ✅ No app crash or hang

### Scenario 3: Error Recovery & Progressive Help 🔄
**Expected Behavior:**
- First retry attempt shows "Attempt 2"
- Second retry attempt shows "Attempt 3"
- After 2+ failures, progressive help appears:
  - "Still having trouble?"
  - Actionable guidance (storage, restart, support)

**Test Steps:**
1. Force initialization failure
2. Test retry button multiple times
3. Observe attempt counter
4. Verify progressive help appears after 2 failures
5. Check help text usefulness

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Retry counter increments correctly
- ✅ Progressive help appears after 2+ failures
- ✅ Help text provides actionable guidance
- ✅ UI remains responsive during retries

### Scenario 4: Crash Reporting Integration 🔄
**Expected Behavior:**
- All initialization attempts logged with timing
- Error events captured with context
- Performance metrics tracked:
  - App startup time
  - Database initialization duration
  - Success/failure rates

**Test Steps:**
1. Launch app and check console logs
2. Force failures and check error reporting
3. Verify performance metrics are logged
4. Confirm error context includes retry count

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Startup time logged to console
- ✅ Database init time tracked
- ✅ Errors include meaningful context
- ✅ Performance alerts for >3s startup or >5s db init

### Scenario 5: Memory & Performance Validation 🔄
**Expected Behavior:**
- App memory usage tracked
- No memory leaks during retry attempts
- State properly cleaned up after errors
- Performance targets met

**Test Steps:**
1. Monitor memory usage during initialization
2. Test multiple retry attempts
3. Check for memory leaks
4. Verify state cleanup after errors
5. Validate performance targets

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Memory usage under 150MB target
- ✅ No memory leaks during retries
- ✅ Clean state reset between attempts
- ✅ Performance alerts working correctly

## 🔍 Testing Infrastructure

### Test Environment:
- **Device:** Android emulator/device
- **Build:** Debug APK with timeout fixes
- **Monitoring:** Console logs + CrashReportingService output

### Test Data Sources:
```typescript
// Console output from CrashReportingService
[INFO] App startup time: XXXms
[INFO] Database initialization: XXXms (success/failure)
[ERROR] Database initialization timeout after 5000ms
[WARNING] App startup time exceeded target (>3000ms)
```

### Performance Benchmarks:
- **Normal DB Init:** < 100ms ✅
- **App Startup:** < 3 seconds (target)
- **Timeout Trigger:** Exactly 5 seconds
- **Memory Usage:** < 150MB during active use

## 📊 Test Results Template

| Scenario | Status | Duration | Notes |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Normal Initialization | ⏳ | - | Waiting for APK |
| Timeout Protection | ⏳ | - | Need to test 5s timeout |
| Error Recovery UI | ⏳ | - | Test retry mechanism |
| Crash Reporting | ⏳ | - | Verify logging works |
| Performance Validation | ⏳ | - | Check memory targets |

## 🎯 Pass/Fail Criteria

### PASS Requirements:
- ✅ All 5 scenarios complete successfully
- ✅ No app crashes or infinite hangs
- ✅ Error messages clear and actionable
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ Monitoring/logging functional

### FAIL Conditions:
- ❌ App hangs indefinitely (critical failure)
- ❌ Timeout doesn't trigger after 5 seconds
- ❌ Error recovery UI broken or confusing
- ❌ Memory leaks during retry attempts
- ❌ Performance significantly degraded

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing

### If Tests PASS:
1. **Production Hardening Phase 1: COMPLETE** ✅
2. Move to **Phase 2: Real Device Testing**
3. Or proceed to **Epic 3: Settlement Optimization**

### If Tests FAIL:
1. Debug and fix identified issues
2. Re-run failing test scenarios
3. Update implementation as needed
4. Repeat until all tests pass
